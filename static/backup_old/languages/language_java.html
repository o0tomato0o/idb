                Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

                    Are you interested in building Identity infrastructure for the cloud? Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure team is building new Infrastructure-as-a-Service technologies that operate at high scale in a broadly distributed multi-tenant cloud environment. Our customers run their businesses on our cloud, and our mission is to provide them with best in class compute, storage, networking, database, security, and an ever expanding set of foundational cloud-based services.
                    We’re looking for Software Developer with expertise and passion in solving difficult problems in distributed systems, virtualized infrastructure, and highly available services. If this is you, at Oracle you can design and build innovative new systems from the ground up. These are exciting times in our space - we are growing fast, still at an early stage, functioning like a startup and working on ambitious new initiatives. An engineer at any level can have significant technical and business impact.
                    As a Software Developer, you will own and lead software architecture and development for Authentication and Authorization components of Oracle’s Cloud Identity Infrastructure.  You should be a distributed systems generalist, able to build broad systems interactions, while being very hands-on, able to dive deep into any part of the stack and lower level system interactions. You should value simplicity and scale, work comfortably in a collaborative, agile environment, and be excited to learn.

                    Do you want to help developers monetize and advertise their apps across mobile phones and tablets?
                    We are looking for a software development engineer to build back-end services for the next generation Mobile Advertising Demand platform. This platform will extend frictionless advertising capabilities for digital and physical goods enabling our customers promote goods through a seamless experience. You will drive innovation on a number of technologies across campaign and image optimization techniques. You will work on a distributed system leveraging AWS that would manage campaigns to meet service level goals. This is a unique opportunity to learn about the advertising supply/demand dynamics and build software solutions to manage delivery of advertising budgets. You will work with partner teams that display ads across all mobile platforms e.g. iOS, Android, HTML5 as well as other advertising exchanges. As a key team member, you will own major deliverables through all aspects of the development cycle: scoping, design, implementation, testing on solutions delivered.
                    You thrive in a start-up like environment where flexibility, teamwork, and delivering rock solid, customer focused solutions on short timelines is paramount. You enjoy working on complex system software, tackling tough challenges, and feel strongly not only about building good software but about making that software achieve its goals in operational reality. You show a strong sense of ownership, bias for action, agility, creativity, and ingenuity.
                    Join our team and deliver game changing mobile advertising solutions that engage our customers.
