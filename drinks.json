I'm about 35% scottish, so the Drambuie takes care of more than enough...especially since my Grandfather lived till 78 years old and he drank scotch whisky every day of his life, and smoked cigarettes. The Blackberry Brandy was a favorite home remedy for sickness, according to my other grandfather...who snuck some to my little sister several years ago when she was sick abd conventional medicines werent working. The sweet & Sour helps to soften the high alcohol content, and the Energy Drink is my personal favorite. It helps keep the senses sharp while adding carbonation and fruity flavor to the alcohol.

I found a couple of grapefruit cocktail recipes online. One used Squirt, another used Grenadine and Sprite, another using Sweet & Sour... but none satisfied me.  This recipe is a combination of the best ingredients I tried with those other drinks and, to my astonishment, has become one of my favorite drinks of all time!  The sour from the grapefruit and sweet from the grenadine fuse perfectly in such a way that you can barely taste the alcohol so watch out; this drink will fuck you up fairly quickly.
